# Product Philosophy

## Core Mentalité

DeesseJS provides the essential building blocks for creating applications without attempting to provide every possible feature out of the box.

## Approach

### Foundation Over Features

- Focus on providing the most important building blocks
- Enable developers to build what they need
- Avoid feature bloat

### Key Building Blocks

- Authentication
- Payments
- Collections/ORM
- Admin Dashboard
- Cache & Reactivity
- Plugin System

### Developer Freedom

- Get the hard parts done
- Build the rest your way
- No opinionated constraints beyond core infrastructure

## Not a "Everything Included" CMS

DeesseJS is not designed to be a feature-complete CMS with every possible functionality. Instead, it provides the critical foundations that applications typically need, then gets out of the way.

### What DeesseJS Provides

- Core infrastructure (auth, payments, database)
- Developer tools (ORM, caching, reactivity)
- Extensibility framework (plugins, admin dashboard)

### What Developers Build

- Custom business logic
- Domain-specific features
- Unique user experiences
- Specialized integrations

## The Goal

Give developers the strongest possible foundation to build amazing applications, without dictating how those applications should work.
