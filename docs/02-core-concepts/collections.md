# Collections System

## Overview

The collections system serves as the foundation for DeesseJS's ORM capabilities. It provides a powerful and flexible way to define and manage data structures, similar to PayloadCMS but with enhanced capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Collection Definition
Collections are defined in `deesse.config.ts` and represent your data models.

### Automatic ORM Method Generation

For each collection, DeesseJS automatically generates a comprehensive set of methods:
- CRUD operations
- Query builders
- Custom operations

This eliminates the need to manually write repetitive data access code.

## Collection Power

The collections system in DeesseJS is designed to be more powerful than traditional collection-based CMS:
- Enhanced flexibility
- Greater extensibility
- Deeper integration with the Next.js ecosystem
