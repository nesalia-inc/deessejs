# Visual Page Editor (Future)

## Concept

A visual page editor that combines the best of Unity and Figma for building pages with both visual design and backend integration.

## Unity + Figma Hybrid

### Visual Design (Figma-like)
- Drag and drop interface
- Visual layout editing
- Style and appearance controls
- Design system integration
- Real-time visual feedback

### Backend Logic (Unity-like)
- Connect backend elements to visual components
- Add interactivity and logic
- Data binding to collections
- Event handling
- Component behaviors

## The Mix

### Design Meets Functionality
- Create beautiful designs visually
- Attach backend functionality to any element
- Bind data from collections to UI components
- Add interactive behaviors without code
- Preview both design and functionality

## Use Cases

- **Marketing Pages**: Visual design with CMS content integration
- **Dynamic Pages**: Beautiful layouts with real-time data binding
- **Interactive Components**: UI elements connected to backend logic
- **Prototype to Production**: Design in the editor, deploy with full backend

## Status

**Coming Later**

This is a planned feature for future development.
