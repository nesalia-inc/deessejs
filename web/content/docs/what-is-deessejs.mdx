# What is DeesseJS?

DeesseJS is a modern, headless CMS framework designed specifically for Next.js that provides a complete content management solution while maintaining the flexibility and performance that developers love.

## Core Philosophy

DeesseJS is built as a **WordPress-like CMS designed specifically for developers**, built as a Next.js overlay. It runs as a layer over Next.js without modifying existing Next.js patterns, allowing seamless integration with your existing applications.

## Key Features

### 📦 Collection-Based Content Management

Define your content structure with typed schemas and manage them through an intuitive admin interface:

```typescript
// deesse.config.ts
export const config = defineConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'posts',
      fields: [
        { name: 'title', type: 'string', required: true },
        { name: 'content', type: 'richtext', required: true },
        { name: 'published', type: 'boolean', defaultValue: false },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

### ⚡ Server-First Architecture

Optimized for Next.js App Router and Server Components, DeesseJS delivers exceptional performance with:
- Server-side rendering by default
- Automatic code splitting
- Edge runtime support
- Smart caching strategies

### 🎨 Visual Page Editor

Build pages visually with drag-and-drop components, allowing content creators to design pages without touching code.

### 🔄 Auto-Generated API

RESTful API automatically generated from your collections with full TypeScript support:

```typescript
import { db } from '@deessejs/db'

const posts = await db.posts.findMany({
  where: { published: true },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
})
```

### ⚙️ Type-Safe by Default

Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types from your content schemas, ensuring type safety throughout your application.
